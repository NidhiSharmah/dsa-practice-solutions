Question:-

Given a positive integer n, compute and return the sum of all prime numbers between 1 and n (inclusive).

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  

Examples:

Input: n = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: 2, 3 and 5 are prime numbers between 1 and 5(inclusive), and their sum is 2 + 3 + 5 = 10.
Input: n = 10
Output: 17
Explanation: 2, 3, 5 and 7 are prime numbers between 1 and 10(inclusive), and their sum is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105

class Solution:
    def isprime(self, num):
        if num < 2 or (num % 2 == 0 and num != 2):
            return False
        for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    def prime_Sum(self, n):
        return sum(i for i in range(2, n + 1) if self.isprime(i))
